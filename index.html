We support the statewide effort to reform the California Democratic Party by pledging to run corporate-free campaigns in this election and in the future. By running bold progressive candidates for the Central Committee, we seek to empower the local Democratic party to become more inclusive, more open to new membership and make sure that a progressive "people before profits" platform has a dominant voice on this committee. We are running as the People-Powered Progressives for Alameda County. <a href="/press-release.html">(Initial press release)</a>

County Committees drive the front-line efforts of the California Democratic Party: registering and educating voters, protecting the right to vote, and working to elect candidates who will fight for our values.

</p></header></article></section><section class="problem"><article class="textual"><header><h2>Why do we need a change?</h2><p>The Alameda County Central Committee — representing our area in the California Democratic Party — is not representative of our progressive spirit, nor the diversity of Alameda County. In AD18 for example, there is only 1 Black person elected to the Committee and only 4 representatives from Oakland out of 10 seats. There currently are no Black men elected to serve on the body representing the entire county!</p><p>The Central committee is supposed to represent the grassroots, and be a gatekeeper for all of the politicians in the area who want to represent us. But over the years, that has turned upside down, and now they seem to exist to support and defend the politicians currently in power, against the interests of the people they are supposed to represent.
</p><p>In the 2018 elections, the Central Committee generally endorsed the <em>least</em> progressive candidates for local and state offices, and tried to silence progressive voices on important issues. <b>Most incumbent representatives have held their seats for decades and are committed to maintaining the old status quo despite the groundswell of progressive change which is transforming the Democratic Party.</b></p><p>It’s time for a change!
